# **App Name**: InterviewAI

## Core Features:

- Competency Extraction: Extract core competencies from a job description using AI. It will identify the key skills, tools, and business outcomes to create targeted questions.
- Question Generation: Generate technical, scenario-based, and behavioral interview questions tailored to each competency.  It serves as a tool that follows a specific framework to produce a well-rounded set of questions for each competency.
- Model Answer Creation: Provide model answers for each generated question to guide interviewers.  The AI produces concise exemplar answers, setting a clear benchmark for interviewers.
- Scoring Rubric Generation: Create a scoring rubric with weighted criteria for fair evaluation.  The AI generates 4-5 criteria with explicit weights that sum to 1.0, providing a structured evaluation framework.
- Accordion Display: Display generated questions and answers in an accordion format for easy navigation. The UI should render the questions and answers in a clear, collapsible structure.
- Panelist Scoring: Allow panelists to input scores and notes during interviews. Persist and retain these values during the process. Include a scoring slider from 1-5, allow input to persist the values, and add fields for personal notes.
- Customization Options: Enable recruiters to tweak question wording and re-weight criteria as needed. Implement a regenerate feature, which calls the AI a second time to edit/re-generate the question, as well as being able to edit model responses.
