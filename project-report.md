## 3. Technical Architecture

RecruTake is built on a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack, prioritizing server-side rendering, type safety, and seamless AI integration.

### 3.1. Frontend

-   **Framework**: **Next.js 15 (App Router)** was chosen for its performance benefits, server components, and streamlined routing. The App Router paradigm allows for efficient data fetching and rendering, which is crucial for an interactive application like RecruTake.
-   **Language**: **TypeScript** is used throughout the project to ensure type safety, improve code quality, and enhance developer experience by catching errors during development.
-   **UI Library**: **React 18** is the foundational library for building the user interface, utilizing functional components and hooks for state management.
-   **Component Library**: **ShadCN UI** provides a set of beautifully designed, accessible, and composable components (e.g., Cards, Accordions, Sliders, Buttons) that are built on top of Tailwind CSS and Radix UI. This accelerates development while maintaining a high degree of customization.
-   **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** is used for all styling. It's a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development directly within the markup, configured with the project's specific color theme (dark slate blue, lavender, light gray).

### 3.2. Backend & AI

-   **AI Framework**: **Firebase Genkit (v1.x)** is the core of the application's intelligence. It acts as an abstraction layer to orchestrate calls to large language models (LLMs). Genkit's flow-based architecture and integrated schema validation make it ideal for building reliable and structured AI agents.
-   **Generative Model**: **Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash** is the primary LLM used for all generative tasks. It was selected for its strong reasoning capabilities, context understanding (including analyzing uploaded documents like resumes), and ability to adhere to structured JSON output schemas.
-   **Schema Definition & Validation**: **Zod** is used to define the input and output schemas for all Genkit flows. This is a critical piece of the architecture, as it forces the AI to return data in a predictable, well-structured JSON format, preventing errors and ensuring data integrity between the AI and the frontend.

### 3.3. Hosting

-   **Platform**: **Firebase App Hosting** provides a fully managed, serverless environment for deploying Next.js applications. It offers seamless integration with the Google Cloud ecosystem, automatic scaling, and a global CDN, ensuring the application is fast and reliable for users worldwide.

## 4. Application Logic & AI Flows

The application's logic is primarily encapsulated within Genkit flows, which are server-side TypeScript functions that interact with the Gemini model.

### 4.1. `generateInterviewKit` Flow

This is the main AI agent responsible for creating the interview kit from scratch.

1.  **Input**: Takes the job description, Unstop profile link, and an optional resume file (as a Base64 data URI).
2.  **Analysis**: The flow sends all this context to the Gemini model. The prompt instructs the AI to perform a deep, synthesized analysis of all inputs, with the Job Description as the primary source of truth and the resume for personalization.
3.  **Core Logic within the Prompt**:
    -   **Competency Identification**: The AI is instructed to identify 5-7 core competencies from the JD.
    -   **Question Generation**: It generates 25+ questions calibrated to the candidate's experience level. It is strictly instructed to derive most questions from the JD's technical requirements and limit resume-specific questions to 2-3 at most. It also looks for career gaps/shifts to inform one potential question.
    -   **Model Answers & Notes**: For each question, it generates a detailed, multi-point model answer and a strategic note for the interviewer, including the standardized guidance on partial credit.
    -   **Scoring Rubric**: It creates 3-5 weighted scoring criteria directly tied to the key skills of the role.
4.  **Output**: The AI returns a single JSON object matching the `GenerateInterviewKitOutputSchema` defined with Zod.
5.  **Post-processing**: After receiving the AI's output, the backend code performs final validation and sanitization. It adds unique IDs (`randomUUID`) to all competencies, questions, and rubric items. It also normalizes the rubric weights to ensure they sum to 1.0, preventing mathematical errors in the UI.

### 4.2. `customizeInterviewKit` Flow

This flow handles the refinement of an existing interview kit.

1.  **Input**: It receives the original context (JD, resume) along with the current state of the `competencies` and `scoringRubric`, which may include user edits.
2.  **Logic**: The prompt instructs the AI to act as an expert strategist. It must respect the user's edits but use its judgment to refine the kit for quality and consistency. It recalibrates question difficulty, ensures alignment with the role, and improves the clarity of notes and model answers based on the user's changes.
3.  **Output**: It returns the refined `competencies` and `scoringRubric`, which are then updated in the application's state.

## 5. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)

The UI is designed to be clean, professional, and intuitive.

-   **Layout**: The main page features a two-column layout. The left column contains the input form for the job description, Unstop link, and resume upload. The right column is the dynamic output area where the generated kit appears.
-   **State Management**: React's `useState` hook manages the application's state, including input fields, loading status, and the final interview kit object.
-   **Interactivity**:
    -   **Accordions**: Competencies are displayed in `Accordion` components, allowing the user to expand and collapse them to focus on one area at a time.
    -   **Scoring**: For each question, a `Slider` component allows the interviewer to input a score from 1 to 10.
    -   **Notes**: A `Textarea` is provided for each question, allowing panelists to record their observations. All scores and notes are persisted in the component's state.
-   **Asynchronous Operations**: When the "Generate Kit" button is clicked, the `isLoading` state is set to true, displaying a loading spinner and preventing further submissions. The application makes an asynchronous call to the `generateInterviewKit` flow. `try...catch` blocks are used to handle potential errors, displaying a user-friendly `Toast` notification if the generation fails.

## 6. Conclusion

RecruTake successfully demonstrates the power of modern web technologies and generative AI to solve a real-world business problem. By combining the strengths of Next.js for a performant frontend and Firebase Genkit for structured AI orchestration, the application provides a valuable tool that enhances the quality, fairness, and efficiency of the technical recruitment process.
